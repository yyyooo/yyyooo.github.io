Wetry is a dedicated browser for easy access to weibo and zhihu websites. Its built-in translation function can automatically translate web content into the selected language.

In addition, it can also help users quickly enter Chinese (even if they don't know anything about Chinese), which makes it easier to communicate with other weibo and zhihu users. Next, I will briefly introduce the functions of this app. If you have any questions or suggestions, please leave a comment at the bottom of the article~
